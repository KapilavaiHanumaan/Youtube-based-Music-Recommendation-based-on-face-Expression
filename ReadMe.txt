🚀 Project Launch: Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System 🎵😄

I'm excited to share my latest project — a smart Music Recommendation System that uses facial expression recognition to suggest music tailored to your current mood!

🔍 What it Does:
🎯 Detects real-time facial emotions using computer vision
🎼 Recommends music from YouTube based on your mood (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.)
📱 Built using Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and MediaPipe

⚙️ Key Features:
✅ Emotion detection with facial landmarks
✅ Music search via YouTube integration
✅ Lightweight and fast user interface
✅ All powered by Python & machine learning

🧠 Tech Stack:

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV & MediaPipe

NumPy, Streamlit

Web Browser Automation

📸 Requirements: Webcam + Internet
